DS2450 Quad A/D Converter
Create a "DS2450 Analog Sensor" with 4 pin inputs. Read each analog pin and publish the digitized values. This could be used with any analog sensor to read and publish its values.

Create an "Analog Mux Sensor" that uses a multiplexer to read from multiple analog sensors on different pins. The mux is switched to read each sensor, and the values are read using a single DS2450. This minimizes the needed pins and 1-wire chips.

Use a DS2450 internally in a custom component to read analog data. For example, a theoretical " pH Monitor" component could use a DS2450 to read an analog pH sensor.

A basic class for the DS2450 could look like this:

cpp
Copy
class DS2450Sensor : public OneWireBusDevice {
  public:
    DS2450Sensor(OneWireBusComponent *parent, uint64_t address);

    uint16_t read_channel(uint8_t channel);
  
  private:
    bool start_conversion(uint8_t channel);
    bool read_result();
}; 

uint16_t DS2450Sensor::read_channel(uint8_t channel) {
  if (channel > 3) return 0; // Invalid channel
  
  this->start_conversion(channel);
  // Wait for conversion time 
  if (!this->read_result()) return 0;
  
  // Parse result to get 16-bit digitized value of channel 
}
